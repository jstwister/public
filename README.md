# JSTwister public issue tracker


JSTwister is a Javascript productivity booster. 
It's goal is to offer all sorts of common refactors(eg adding automatically imports statements in code etc ) and unit testing assistance.
Currently it is in early alpha, meaning is under heavy development and the feature set is slim.

The plan is to gradually add super useful features to it, depending on the demand and feedback coming from you.

Follow it's development at https://www.jstwister.com/docs/ or follow us on twitter (@jstweetster).
